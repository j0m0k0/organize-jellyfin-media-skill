description: Organize movie and TV/serial folders for Jellyfin naming conventions with IMDb metadata provider IDs. Use when Codex needs to inspect, rename, or restructure a media folder for Jellyfin Movies or Shows libraries, including skipping already-canonical folders, adding `[imdbid-tt...]` identifiers, planning safe renames, and moving sidecars/extras without deleting media.

# Organize Jellyfin Media

## Core Rules

Follow Jellyfin's current documentation for Movies and TV Shows. If the user provides links, browse them first because conventions can change. For details, read `references/jellyfin-conventions.md`.

Never delete media. Prefer reversible moves and renames. Archive stale `.nfo`, screenshots, release notes, and unrelated release artifacts under `other/`, `_archived_release_dirs/`, or another clearly named archive folder unless the user explicitly asks for deletion.

Skip any top-level movie or series folder that is already in canonical Jellyfin form:

```text
Title (Year) [imdbid-tt1234567]
```

Only touch skipped folders if the user explicitly asks to normalize internals too.

## Workflow

1. Inspect the target root with `find` or `rg --files`. Count videos, files, and top-level entries before changing anything.
2. Classify the root as `movies`, `shows`, or ask if it is ambiguous. Do not mix movie and show rules unless the user explicitly has a mixed library.
3. Build a reviewed mapping for every non-canonical target:
   - `source`: current top-level folder or file name relative to the root.
   - `type`: `movie` or `show`.
   - `title`: canonical provider title.
   - `year`: first release year.
   - `imdbid`: IMDb ID as `tt...`.
4. Verify IMDb IDs from reliable sources. Prefer explicit IMDb pages or metadata-provider pages; use web search when local metadata is stale or absent.
5. Run a dry-run plan before changing files:

```bash
python3 scripts/jellyfin_media_plan.py \
  /path/to/library --library-type movies --mapping /path/to/mapping.json
```

6. Review the plan for collisions, unexpected moves, and skipped canonical folders.
7. Apply only after the dry-run is clean:

```bash
python3 scripts/jellyfin_media_plan.py \
  /path/to/library --library-type movies --mapping /path/to/mapping.json --execute
```

8. For complex internals, especially TV episode moves or old release sidecars, inspect and finish manually after the top-level dry-run. Use the script as a conservative helper, not as a substitute for reviewing the media tree.
9. Verify afterward:
   - Top-level folders are canonical.
   - No top-level video files remain in movie libraries.
   - Show folders contain `Season 00`, `Season 01`, etc.
   - Main movie videos start with the parent folder name.
   - Active stale `.nfo` files are not beside main media unless intentionally retained.
   - File counts and video counts are unchanged unless the user explicitly requested otherwise.

## Movie Handling

Use one folder per movie:

```text
Movies/Movie Name (Year) [imdbid-tt1234567]/Movie Name (Year) [imdbid-tt1234567].mkv
```

For multiple versions, every video filename must start exactly with the folder name, followed by ` - Label`:

```text
Movie Name (Year) [imdbid-tt1234567] - Extended.mkv
```

Move old release `.nfo` files out of the active movie folder, usually to `other/original-nfo/`, so Jellyfin can fetch fresh metadata from the IMDb provider ID.

## Show Handling

Use one folder per series, with padded season folders:

```text
Shows/Series Name (Year) [imdbid-tt1234567]/Season 01/Series Name (Year) [imdbid-tt1234567] S01E01.mkv
```

Use `Season 00` for specials. Do not abbreviate season folders as `S01` or `SE01`.

When renaming episodes, preserve existing episode titles after the `SxxEyy` token if present. Do not invent episode titles unless the user asks.

## Mapping Format

The helper script accepts either an object with an `items` list or a list directly:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "source": "Old.Release.Name.2024.1080p",
      "type": "movie",
      "title": "Movie Name",
      "year": 2024,
      "imdbid": "tt1234567"
    }
  ]
}
```

Keep mappings in a temporary file near the working folder or in `/tmp`. Do not store user-specific media inventories in the skill itself.

## Helper Script Limits

`scripts/jellyfin_media_plan.py` is a conservative planner/executor, not a metadata resolver. It does not look up IMDb IDs. It expects a reviewed mapping and aborts on collisions.

By default, the script safely handles top-level canonicalization and top-level movie files. It skips already-canonical folders. To ask it to normalize internals of an already-canonical movie folder, add `"normalize": true` to that mapping item; only do this after inspecting the folder. Show internals require manual review because episode layouts and sidecars vary. If the media layout is unusual, inspect manually and adjust rather than forcing the script.
